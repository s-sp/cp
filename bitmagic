0 The bitwise algorithms are found to be much faster and are some times used to improve the efficiency of a program.
1  &, |, and ^ take two numbers as operands and operate on every corresponding pair of bits of the two numbers.
2 <<, >> take two numbers, left shifts the bits of the first operand, the second operand decides the number of places to shift.
3 The left shift and right shift operators cannot be used with negative numbers.
4 ~ (bitwise NOT) Takes one number and inverts all bits of it.
5 The bitwise XOR operator is the most useful operator from technical interview perspective.
*6 The left-shift and right-shift operators by 1 are equivalent to multiplication and division by 2 respectively.
*7 The value of expression (x & 1) would be non-zero only if x is odd, otherwise the value would be zero.
8 Set/unset/toggle/check the kth bit in a number n using 1, 4, 6.
9 Find log base 2 of a number using 6.
*10 To toggle bits of a number simply subtract the number from the value obtained when all the bits are equal to 1.
*11 We can easily swap two numbers say a and b by using the XOR(^) operator by applying below operations:
    a ^= b;
    b ^= a; 
    a ^= b;
*12 If a number N is a power of 2 then bitwise-AND(&) of N and N-1 will be zero. We can say that N is a power of 2 or not based on the value of N&(N-1).
13 Find log base 2 to find number of digits, raise this to 2 to find most significant bit.
*14 Given a number N, the task is to find the XOR of all numbers from 1 to N.
    Find the remainder of N by moduling it with 4.
    If rem = 0, then xor will be same as N.
    If rem = 1, then xor will be 1.
    If rem = 2, then xor will be N+1.
    If rem = 3 ,then xor will be 0.
*15 Given an array arr[] of N positive elements. The task is to find the Maximum AND Value generated by any pair of the element from the array.
    Naive approach is O(n^2). O(n) possible, sieve method.
16 Minimum XOR Value Pair: Naive is O(n^2), half efficient: O(nlogn) (sort and check pairs of adjacent elements), best: O(n) using tries(don't need to know).
*17 << left shift is increasing.
**18 & has less precedence than ==.
