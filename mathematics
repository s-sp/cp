1 double(9/5) is equal to 1, watch out every time you divide.

2 cpp has floor()

3 The floor value of log base 10 increased by 1, of any number, gives the number of digits present in that number.

4 (A + B) mod C = (A mod C + B mod C) mod C, works similarly for - and * also, but not division.

5 You can compute the LCM of more than two numbers by iteratively computing the LCM of two numbers, i.e. lcm(a,b,c) = lcm(a,lcm(b,c))

6 A quick way to swap a and b, this method is fast and doesnâ€™t require the use of 3rd variable.
  a ^= b; 
  b ^= a; 
  a ^= b;
  
7 n = n << 1;   <-Multiply n with 2
  n = n >> 1;   <-Divide n by 2 
  
8 if (num & 1) 
   cout << "ODD"; 
  else
   cout << "EVEN"; 

9 Caution: Where ever you use '&', be mindful of the fact that == has higher precedence than &. Use parantheses: "if(x&1 == 0)" does not work, write "if((x&1) == 0)".
